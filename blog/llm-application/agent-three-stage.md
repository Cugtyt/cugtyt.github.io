Large Language Model (LLM) Agents represent a groundbreaking frontier in artificial intelligence, 
often called the foundation of Software 3.0. These systems go beyond traditional LLM applications 
by combining advanced language models with specialized agent architectures. While 
standalone LLMs excel at specific tasks, their potential remains limited without the ability to 
interact dynamically with their environment. This article presents a three-stage framework for 
understanding how LLM Agents evolve.

## Stage 1: Learning from Well-Recorded Data (Pure LLM Model) - 照猫画虎

The first stage focuses on developing LLMs through comprehensive training on vast, carefully selected datasets.
During this phase, models acquire fundamental capabilities:
mastering language patterns, understanding grammar, and grasping context.
The training process produces models capable of generating coherent, appropriate responses across diverse topics.

Fine-tuning on domain-specific datasets further improves model performance for targeted applications.
This specialized training enables the model to excel in particular scenarios,
resulting in a sophisticated language system capable of human-like text generation.

While these models function as capable agents—answering questions, making recommendations, and maintaining conversations—their effectiveness remains limited by their training data. Key limitations include:

- **Static knowledge base**: Information frozen at training time
- **No environmental interaction**: Unable to access real-time information
- **Limited adaptability**: Cannot respond to rapidly changing contexts
- **Update constraints**: Knowledge refresh requires expensive retraining

## Stage 2: Adapting to Environment (Model with Memory, Tools, and Planning) - 适应环境

Stage two marks a major breakthrough where LLM Agents go beyond their training limitations by actively 
learning from their operational environment. This evolution introduces crucial capabilities that 
enable real-time adaptation and continuous improvement.

At this stage, agents integrate some essential components:

**Memory**: Systems that maintain context across interactions, enabling the agent 
to build understanding and learn from past experiences.

**Tools**: External interfaces including APIs and data streams that provide access to current information 
beyond the training data, allowing the agent to retrieve real-time data and execute actions.

**Planning**: Strategic reasoning that enables agents to break down complex tasks, 
create multi-step action sequences, and adjust their approach based on results.

Since tool outputs and real-world feedback weren't part of the original training data, 
models must dynamically adapt their behavior based on this new information. 
This evolution transforms static responders into adaptive systems capable of handling complex, 
changing situations through coordinated memory, tool usage, and strategic planning.

## Stage 3: Transforming the Environment (Creating Tools, Editing Memory, and Manufacturing Subagents) - 改造环境

The third stage represents the peak of LLM Agent evolution,
where systems go beyond using tools to become active creators and environmental architects.
Rather than just learning from or adapting to their environment, these agents actively reshape it to better serve their goals.

Advanced agents demonstrate remarkable independence through three key capabilities:

**Tool Creation**: Writing executable code and designing entirely new tools based on user needs and feedback. 
These agents can identify gaps in their capabilities and independently develop solutions to address them.

**Memory Manipulation**: Actively editing and restructuring their own memory systems to improve performance, 
organizing information more efficiently, and creating new memory patterns that better serve changing needs.

**Subagent Manufacturing**: Most remarkably, these agents can create and manage specialized subagents 
to handle specific subtasks. This layered system allows the primary agent to delegate complex problems, 
creating a network of specialized agents where each focuses on its area of expertise while contributing 
to the overall goal.

Through these capabilities, agents become active participants in the development process,
using their understanding of language and context to create innovative, scalable solutions.
This transformation from passive responders to active creators marks a fundamental shift in human-AI collaboration.
These agents become true partners in the innovation process, capable of identifying problems, 
designing solutions, implementing them, and even delegating tasks through their created subagent network.

## Conclusion

The three-stage framework—照猫画虎 (learning from data), 适应环境 (adapting to environment), and 改造环境 (transforming environment)—provides a clear roadmap for understanding LLM Agent evolution.
It's important to note that these stages don't replace one another;
rather, they represent different operational layers that work together in production environments.

Each stage serves distinct purposes:
- **Stage 1** provides the foundational intelligence and language understanding that powers all subsequent capabilities
- **Stage 2** adds dynamic adaptability through memory, tools, and planning for real-world applications
- **Stage 3** enables creative problem-solving, autonomous system development, and management of multi-agent networks

In production systems, these layers work together:
the base model (Stage 1) provides core reasoning,
the adaptive layer (Stage 2) ensures relevance through environmental interaction,
while the creative layer (Stage 3) drives innovation through tool creation, memory optimization, and subagent coordination.
This layered architecture allows organizations to deploy the appropriate level of agent sophistication based on their specific needs,
resources, and risk tolerance.

As we advance through these stages, we're not discarding earlier capabilities but building upon them,
creating increasingly sophisticated AI systems that enhance human capabilities across the full spectrum—from simple queries to complex, distributed problem-solving through created agent networks.
