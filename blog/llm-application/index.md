## [**The Three-Stage Evolution of LLM Agents: From Learning to Creating**](https://cugtyt.github.io/blog/llm-application/agentlauncher)

> AgentLauncher GitHub: https://github.com/Cugtyt/agentlauncher
>
> AgentLauncher is an event-driven, multi-agent framework for solving complex tasks by dynamically generating sub-agents.
> The main agent coordinates strategy, while sub-agents handle specialized tasks.
> Agent lifecycles are managed automatically, similar to jobs in Kubernetes—sub-agents are lightweight and ephemeral.

## [**The Three-Stage Evolution of LLM Agents: From Learning to Creating**](https://cugtyt.github.io/blog/llm-application/agent-three-stage)

> * **照猫画虎** (learning from data) - Foundation models trained on curated datasets
> * **适应环境** (adapting to environment) - Agents with memory, tools, and planning capabilities  
> * **改造环境** (transforming environment) - Creative agents that build tools and manufacture subagents

## [**Process Supervision Is All You Need for AI Coding**](https://cugtyt.github.io/blog/llm-application/ai-coding-process)

> Agent-based coding is increasingly popular in AI development,
> but it often veers off course.
> To achieve better results and minimize risks,
> active supervision of the process is essential.

## [**Massive Search: LLM Structured Outputs is All You Need**](https://cugtyt.github.io/blog/llm-application/massive-search)

> Executing complex searches across entities with diverse attributes
> —such as text, numbers, booleans, and images—can be challenging.
> These searches often require intricate queries,
> potentially involving joins across multiple data sources.
> For example, searching for a book might involve filtering by its title,
> description, price, user comments, and cover image simultaneously.
> 
> Massive Search provides a method for querying such complex
> but logically grouped data by leveraging LLM Structured Outputs.
> "Logically grouped" means all the data pertains to the same core entity,
> like a specific book product.

## [**Manufacturer-Executor-Evaluator: A General LLM Agentic Pattern for Collective Intelligence**](https://cugtyt.github.io/blog/llm-application/mee)

> * Manufacturer is responsible for generating the task specification based on the task examples, 
> which is the system start point and objective,
> * the Executor is responsible for executing the task based on the task specification, it is the final solution output,
> * and the Evaluator is responsible for evaluating the execution result to make sure the task specification
> meets the objective, feedback or comments from Evaluator will be used to improve the task specification in the next iteration.
